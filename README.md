=========

PHP implementation of Grunt

1. Install Node.js packages

    npm install
    
2. Open site in browser



NOTE: The PHP file is running from the source folder, placing it in the same scope that Grunt expects, whether it's installed locally (``npm install`` for this project's package.json) or globally (``npm install -g grunt``).
